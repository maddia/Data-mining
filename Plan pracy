NCT pass rate analysis and forecast for given car using Data mining methods 


1.	Introduction (including Problem statement, Goal). 

Problem statement – given the car model and year, what is probability that it will fail NCT test and what kind of 
problems with car we can expect?

In Business goal – For example Taxi Company want to invest in new cars but one of factors for decision making will 
be NCT pass rate. We can help them to choose a correct car. 


2.	Data Description (Magda)

3.	Data Preparation (NAN, OUTLIERS if any) KPI set up, ratios, percentages, binomial and nominal attributes.  
(If you have any suggestion to add column say in whatsup to make sure that we all know and add changes to github – 
although I think we have already calculated perfect ratios for all attributes of car test) (Magda)

4. Define classification rules for models. (Magda)
4.	Data mining model construction 
4.1	Cluster analysis ( Ania)
4.2	Naïve Bayes classifier (Magda)
4.3	Logistic regression ( Ala)
4.4	Decision Tree (maybe CART) (Ania)

5	Comparison of models and errors. 

6.	Conclusions ( including evaluation of findings - benefits and limitations of data mining models, 
recommendation of model to client)
